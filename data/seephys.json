    "question": "The \"charmed\" particles observed in $e^{+} e^{-}$storage rings have not yet been seen in hadron-hadron interactions. One possible means for detecting such particles is the observation of muons resulting from their leptonic decays. For example, consider a charmed particle $c$ with decay mode \n$$ c \\rightarrow \\mu \nu $$ Unfortunately, the experimental situation is complicated by the presence of muons from $\\pi$ decays. Consider an experiment at Fermilab in which 400 GeV protons strike a thick iron target (beam dump) as depicted in Fig. 4.13. Some of the muons entering the detector will be from $\\pi$ decays and some from $c$ decays (ignore other processes). Calculate the ratio of muons from $c$ decays to those from $\\pi$ decays under the following assumptions: the pions that have suffered interaction in the dump completely disappear from the beam, the energy spectra of both $\\pi$ and $c$ are flat from minimum up to the maximum possible energy, the mass of the $c$ is $2 \\mathrm{GeV} / c^{2}$ and its lifetime is $\\ll 10^{-10} \\mathrm{sec}$, one can ignore muon energy loss in the iron, one can ignore any complications due to the geometry of the muon detector, the $p-p$ inelastic cross section is 30 mb , and the mean charged pion multiplicity in inelastic interactions is 8 . Be specific. State any additional assumptions. Give a numerical value for the ratio at $E_{\\mu}=100 \\mathrm{GeV}$ assuming the total production cross section for $c$ to be $10 \\mu b$ per Fe nucleus and that it decays to $\\mu \nu 10 \\%$ of the time.",
